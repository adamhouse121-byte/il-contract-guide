  <h1>Attorney Review in Illinois — 5 Business Days, Explained</h1>
  <p class="small">What the window is for, how modifications work, when you can cancel, and how to avoid timeline mistakes.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>What this clause is trying to do</h2>
  <p>Give each side’s attorney a brief window after acceptance to review the contract, propose changes, or cancel.</p>
  <h2>What it says (plain English)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Once everyone signs, a <b>clock starts</b> for attorney review (commonly <b>5 business days</b> from acceptance; check your contract).</li>
    <li>During that time, an attorney may approve, propose modifications, or disapprove/cancel per the form.</li>
    <li>If modifications are proposed, the other side can accept, reject, or counter. If you can’t agree within the window (or a written extension), either side may cancel.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How the clock is counted</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Business days</b> usually mean Monday–Friday, excluding standard holidays. Confirm your form.</li>
    <li><b>Day 1</b> is typically the first business day after acceptance.</li>
    <li>If the last day falls on a weekend/holiday, many forms push to the next business day.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Three common paths</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Approve & move forward.</b></li>
    <li><b>Propose modifications.</b> Agree within the window (or a written extension) and continue.</li>
    <li><b>Disapprove/cancel.</b> Only as permitted by your form and within the window.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Buyer tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Engage an attorney early so they’re ready on Day 1.</li>
    <li>Track earnest-money and inspection clocks; these often overlap.</li>
    <li>Ask your attorney to flag HOA/condo docs and special assessments early.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Seller tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Have disclosures and HOA docs ready to speed review.</li>
    <li>If you need a rent‑back, draft it cleanly now.</li>
    <li>Decide in advance which changes you can accept.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What if you miss the window?</h2>
  <p>If neither side acts within time, the contingency may lapse as written. Don’t assume—get written clarity from your attorney.</p>
  <h2>Helpful “write‑it‑in” examples (run by your attorney)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Extension:</b> Attorney review period extended by 2 business days to [date]. All other terms unchanged.</li>
    <li><b>Rent‑back:</b> Seller to remain in possession until [date/time]. Use & Occupancy at $[amount]/day. Security deposit $[amount], refundable at keys delivered and property in substantially same condition.</li>
    <li><b>Clarify escrow timing:</b> Earnest money due within 2 business days of acceptance to [escrowee], check or wire.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <p><b>Does attorney review allow cancel for any reason?</b> Only as permitted by your contract and within the window.</p>
  <p><b>Can we negotiate new items?</b> Yes—if both sides agree in writing during the window.</p>
  <p><b>Do weekends count?</b> Typically no, but confirm your form’s rules.</p>
