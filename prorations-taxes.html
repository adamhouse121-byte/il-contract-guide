  <h1>Taxes & Prorations — How the Money is Calculated</h1><p class='small'>How property taxes, assessments, and HOA items are split at closing.</p><hr>
<h2>Standard Prorations</h2><p>Taxes and certain charges are prorated as of closing so each side pays their share for the period they own the home.</p>
<h2>Improved‑But‑Not‑Fully‑Taxed</h2><p>If the property was improved but not fully taxed for a full year, contracts often require an <b>escrow</b> (e.g., a percentage of price) held until the actual bill is known and the parties settle up.</p>
<h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Ask title/attorney for the estimated tax proration on your <b>settlement statement</b>.</li><li>Confirm HOA special assessments and whether they’re paid or credited.</li></ul>
