  <h1>Inspections in Illinois — Options, Deadlines, and Scripts</h1>
  <p class="small">Pick the right inspection path, hit your deadlines, and use clear language for repair or credit requests.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Common inspection pathways</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Full inspection contingency</b> — request repairs/credits or cancel per terms.</li>
    <li><b>Information‑only</b> — inspect but agree not to request repairs; may still cancel within the window (verify your form).</li>
    <li><b>As‑Is with inspection right</b> — inspect and cancel within the deadline; no repair/credit requests.</li>
    <li><b>No inspection</b> — waive the right entirely (rare and risky).</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Add‑on inspections</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Radon, termite/WDI</li>
    <li>Sewer scope (older homes)</li>
    <li>Well/septic where applicable</li>
    <li>Lead‑based paint awareness for pre‑1978 homes</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Timeline & logistics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Schedule immediately after acceptance.</li>
    <li>Submit any requests <b>in writing</b> before the deadline.</li>
    <li>Plan 1–3 hours on site; expect a same‑day/next‑day report.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Requesting repairs vs. asking for a credit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Repairs</b> — good for straightforward fixes you want done before closing. Ask for <i>licensed</i> contractors and invoices.</li>
    <li><b>Credits</b> — prefer when scope is uncertain or timing is tight; you choose contractor after closing. Applied at closing.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>“Material defects” (plain English)</h2>
  <p>Many forms limit requests to significant items affecting health/safety, structure, or major systems. Cosmetic issues are usually excluded. Confirm your language.</p>
  <h2>Re‑inspection</h2>
  <p>If repairs are agreed, the buyer (or inspector) may re‑inspect before closing to confirm completion—add this right in writing.</p>
  <h2>Scripts & templates</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Repair request:</b> Buyer requests licensed electrician to replace Federal Pacific panel with new [brand], including permit and final inspection, by [date]. Contractor invoice to be provided prior to closing.</li>
    <li><b>Credit request:</b> In lieu of repairs for roof wear noted in Sections 3.1 and 3.4 of the inspection report, buyer requests a $3,500 closing credit.</li>
    <li><b>Information‑only acknowledgement:</b> Buyer conducted inspection for information only per contract and makes no repair requests; buyer proceeding to closing.</li>
    <li><b>As‑Is confirmation with right to cancel:</b> Buyer conducted inspection pursuant to As‑Is selection; buyer elects to proceed with no repair/credit requests.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <p><b>Can I ask for repairs on “as‑is”?</b> Usually no—unless both sides agree to modify the contract in writing.</p>
  <p><b>If the seller refuses all requests, can I cancel?</b> Only if your contingency and timeline allow it. Check your contract.</p>
  <p><b>Should I attend the inspection?</b> Yes—ideally for the final 30–60 minutes to walk through findings.</p>
